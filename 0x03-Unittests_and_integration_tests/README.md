Understanding the difference between Unit test and Integration test

UNIT TEST
Unit testing involves testing individual components or "units" of a software system in isolation.
The goal is to validate that each unit of the application works as expected, without the complexities of dependencies or the full application stack.
Unit tests are typically written by developers as they are building the application, using frameworks like JUnit, Mocha, Jest, etc.
Well-written unit tests make it easier to identify and fix bugs early in the development process.

INTEGRATION TESTING
Integration testing focuses on testing how different components of an application work together.
It verifies that the interfaces between components are working correctly and that the overall system functions as expected.
Integration tests are written after unit tests, and they often involve testing the application with its full set of dependencies.
Integration tests help catch issues that may arise from the interactions between different modules or subsystems.
